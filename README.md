dp-dimension-importer
================

Handles inserting of dimensions into database after input file becomes available;
and creates an event by sending a message to a dimension-imported kafka topic so further processing of the input file can take place.

Requirements
------------------
In order to run the service locally you will need the following:
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
- [Dataset API](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-dataset-api)
- [API AUTH STUB](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-auth-api-stub)

### Getting started

* Clone the repo `go get github.com/ONSdigital/dp-dimension-importer`
* Run kafka and zookeeper
* Run local S3 store
* Run the dataset API, see documentation [here](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-dataset-api)
* Run api auth stub, see documentation [here](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-auth-api-stub)
* Run the application with `make debug`

### Kafka scripts

Scripts for updating and debugging Kafka can be found [here](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-data-tools)(dp-data-tools)

### Healthcheck

 The `/healthcheck` endpoint returns the current status of the service. Dependent services are health checked on an interval defined by the `HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL` environment variable.

 On a development machine a request to the health check endpoint can be made by:

 `curl localhost:23000/healthcheck`
